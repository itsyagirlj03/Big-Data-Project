# Big-Data-Project
About our project I think.
1. How many people still look up anime very often in 2019?
2. How many people look up the same stuff everyday?
3. How many people still look up and test if their IPhone can bend?
4. How many parinoid people still look up killer clowns?
5. How many people still look up pokemon go to catch em all?
